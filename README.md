# Spider Solitaire

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_(solitaire)

I got interested in making my own version of Spider solitaire after reading Raymond Chen's book, _The Old New Thing_, where he claimed that Spider Solitaire was the most-played app in more recent versions of Windows. My lowkey goal with all these browser-based versions of card games is to make something I can play without installing the Microsoft's terrible "Solitaire Collection" app, which is full of ads and in-app purchases.
